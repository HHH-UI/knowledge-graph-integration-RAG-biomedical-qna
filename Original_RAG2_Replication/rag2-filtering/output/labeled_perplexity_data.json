His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen.

On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",
