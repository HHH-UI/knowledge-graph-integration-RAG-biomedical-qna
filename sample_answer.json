    "query": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",

        "abstract": "Background: Impact of resident participation on short-term postoperative outcomes after total elbow arthroplasty has not been studied. The aim was to investigate whether resident participation affects postoperative complication rates, operative time, and length of stay. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry was queried from 2006 to 2012 for patients undergoing total elbow arthroplasty. A 1:1 propensity score match was performed to match resident cases to attending-only cases. Comorbidities, surgical time, and short-term (30-day) postoperative complications were compared between groups. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to compare the rates of postoperative adverse events between groups. Results: After propensity score match, 124 cases (50% with resident participation) were included. Adverse event rate after surgery was 18.5%. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences between attending-only cases and resident involved cases, with regards to short-term major complications, minor complications, or any complications (all p\u2009>\u20090.071). Total operative time was similar between cohorts (149.16 vs. 165.66\u2009min; p\u2009=\u20090.157). No difference was observed in the length of hospital stay (2.95 vs. 2.6 days), p\u2009=\u20090.399. Discussion: Resident participation during total elbow arthroplasty is not associated with increased risk for short-term medical or surgical postoperative complications or operative efficiency."

        "abstract": "Background \u2003Complications after open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for distal radius fractures (DRF) are well documented, but the impact of trainee involvement on postoperative outcomes has not been studied. Questions \u2003Does trainee involvement affect postoperative complication rates and length of hospital stay? Methods \u2003The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried from 2006 to 2012 for patients undergoing DRF ORIF. A 1:1 propensity score matched resident/fellow involved cases to attending-only cases. Demographics, length of stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to evaluate independent predictors of adverse events and to evaluate cases with and without trainee involvement. Results \u2003Overall, 3,003 patients underwent DRF ORIF from 2006 to 2012. After matching, 1,150 cases (50% with resident/fellow involvement) were included. The overall rate of adverse events was 4.4% (46/1,050). There were no significant differences in the short-term complication rate in trainee-involved (2.3%) versus attending-only cases (3.9%) ( p \u2009=\u20090.461). For ORIF of DRF, there were no significant differences, between attending-only cases and resident/fellow-involved cases, with regard to short-term major complications ( p \u2009=\u20090.720) or minor complications ( p \u2009=\u20090.374). Length of hospital stay was similar between cohorts (1.22 vs. 0.98 days) ( p \u2009=\u20090.723). On multivariate analysis, trainee involvement was not an independent predictor of minor, major, or any complication after DRF fixation after controlling for multiple independent factors (all p \u2009>\u20090.364). Discussion \u2003Trainee participation in DRF ORIF is not associated with increased risk of short-term (30 days) medical or surgical postoperative complications. Level of Evidence \u2003This is a Level IV case-control study."

        "abstract": "Objectives: The number of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures continues to rise, a direct consequence of the increase in primary TKA. The number of arthroplasty-trained orthopaedic surgeons has failed to increase at a corresponding rate, and the increased burden will ultimately fall on non-specialized orthopaedists. Resident involvement in primary TKA has not been found to increase postoperative complications, but revision TKA is more complex and the impact of resident involvement has not been well studied. Methods: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, this study identified 1834 revision TKA procedures between the years 2008 and 2012. Of these procedures, 863 included resident involvement. Demographic information, comorbidities, operative times, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day postoperative complications were stratified by resident and non-resident involvement and analyzed. Results: Resident involvement was not associated with a significant increase in short-term complications. Operative times were significantly longer with resident involvement (147.50\u00a0min with resident involvement vs. 124.55\u00a0min without a resident, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Length of stay after procedures with resident involvement was higher by 0.34 days, but this did not reach significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.061). Conclusion: Resident involvement in revision total knee arthroplasty was associated with a significant increase in operative time; however, there were no significant increases in postoperative complication rates within 30 days. These findings support continued resident involvement in revision total knee arthroplasty cases and postoperative management."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The shortage of residents in orthopedic and trauma surgery cannot be denied. To identify the background and possible solutions, a\u00a0survey was conducted among physicians at all levels of expertise. OBJECTIVE: What are the current expectations towards the professional life, particularly of resident doctors? What are the possibilities to realize them in traumatology and orthopedic surgery? MATERIAL AND METHODS: An evaluation of the annual survey 2022 of the Young Forum of the Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery Association (Junges Forum O\u00a0und U) was carried out, including an analysis of the questions and research relevant to the topic on further ways to achieve a balance in the medical profession. RESULTS: Of the resident doctor respondents 76% were open to working part-time and 85% rated the possibility of working remotely as easing the burden. Over half of the respondents spent some time during a residency abroad or would be open to doing so. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of young residents expect a promising future for modern working models, where working part-time and working remotely play a\u00a0role, as do stays abroad. By taking these wishes seriously and pursuing them, it would be possible to recruit new personnel or at least retain those who are already present.",
