Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) is crucial for DNA repair via homologous recombination.
BRCA1 is located on chromosome 17 and helps maintain genomic stability by repairing double-strand DNA breaks.
Mutations in BRCA1 significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in affected individuals.
The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts with a number of other tumor suppressors, DNA repair sensors, and signal transducers.
BRCA1 was first cloned in 1994, and it remains one of the most studied genes in hereditary breast cancer.

Vancomycin is commonly used to treat MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infections, particularly in hospital settings.
MRSA is a type of Staphylococcus aureus bacterium that has become resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin.
Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of cell wall precursors.
Though effective, vancomycin can sometimes cause nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity if not monitored carefully.
Alternative treatments for MRSA may include newer agents like linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline, depending on local resistance patterns.

Gene TP53 is a tumor suppressor and is involved in multiple cancers when mutated.
TP53 encodes the p53 protein, often called the “guardian of the genome,” because it regulates the cell cycle and promotes apoptosis when DNA damage is detected.
Over 50% of human cancers harbor mutations in the TP53 gene, emphasizing its critical role in preventing tumor formation.
Under normal conditions, p53 can activate DNA repair proteins, arrest cell growth, and initiate programmed cell death if the damage is irreparable.
Recent research focuses on p53 reactivation strategies to halt the progression of tumors resistant to conventional therapies.

In addition to BRCA1, the BRCA2 gene also plays a major role in DNA repair via homologous recombination.
Like BRCA1, inherited mutations in BRCA2 dramatically increase the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancers.
Some studies indicate that individuals with BRCA2 mutations may also face a higher risk of prostate, pancreatic, and other cancers.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a growing public health concern, with few effective antibiotic options.
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing most beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems, leading to multi-drug resistant infections.
Treatment of CRE usually relies on combination regimens that may include polymyxins, tigecycline, or newer drugs like ceftazidime-avibactam.

Gene PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog) is another tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in a range of malignancies.
PTEN normally functions to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, a key step in the PI3K/AKT pathway regulating cell growth.
Loss of PTEN can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, contributing to tumor development.

Checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, have revolutionized oncology by unleashing the immune system to target tumor cells.
However, resistance can develop, and ongoing research seeks to identify biomarkers that predict which tumors respond best to immunotherapy.

Statins, commonly used for lowering cholesterol, have been investigated for potential anti-cancer properties.
Some epidemiological studies suggest statins may reduce cancer risk or slow progression in certain contexts, though definitive clinical data are mixed.

Many clinical trials investigate combining traditional chemotherapy (e.g., platinum-based agents) with targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
PARP inhibitors exploit synthetic lethality in cancer cells that lack functional BRCA-mediated repair, leading to cell death.
